Elastic Networks
================

cg_bonds-v6.tcl draws elastic networks in the same way that martinize2 generates them:
finding pairs of atoms within a cutoff distance. I'm not certain this is guaranteed to either
exactly reproduce the underlying topology of the simulation, or be very quick. Here, there is the
option to separate the elastic network generated by martinize2 out for special visualisation using
the -el and -ef flags.

These make some assumptions about what your network looks like, primarily that the force - given by
-ef, and by default 700 for Martini 3 proteins - used for the network is unique in your molecule, ie.
you don't have sidechains/ligands which are bound with the same force constant. Similarly, the short/
long elastic network bonds for beta sheets are identified by their distance parameter, which is
encoded in the force field. I haven't extensively checked this degeneracy assumption, so if it breaks
for you, please let me know.

One other complication with looking at elastic networks is that VMD can't handle atoms with more
than 12 bonds attached. MartiniGlass handles this by inspecting the elastic network and - if any
such atoms are found - removing these "excessive" bonds. This means that while you'll be able to
look at your protein with its network in VMD, the network you see won't contain all the elastic
network bonds that were applied during your simulation. The bonds that were removed get written
to a separate text file for noting in case they're of interest to you.

So in summary, there's no straightforward way to visualise your elastic network like I show in the
picture at the top. However, should you still want it, here's a hack:

* run MartiniGlass -p topol.top -el -ef 500 -vf (replacing -ef 500 with whatever your system requires)
