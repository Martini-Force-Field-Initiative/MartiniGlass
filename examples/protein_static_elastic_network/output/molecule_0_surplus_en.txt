elastic network bonds removed from molecule_0_en.itp
This is for noting in visualisation, not for simulation

These bonds will be missing if you load molecule_0_en.itp in vmd
having been present in your simulation. If you're inspecting your
elastic network because you suspect some simulation error
as a result of how it was constructed, bear this in mind.

This has been done because by default VMD does not draw more than 12 bonds
per atom in an interactive manner (i.e. the bonds are not rendered as static geometry).
To view all bond (in a static manner) the bonds can be rendered using the -cyl flag of MartiniGlass.     i      j func b0 kb
