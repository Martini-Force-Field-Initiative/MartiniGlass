## Multiple Go models

Input and output files for the tutorial on visualising systems containing multiple
proteins with go models with MartiniGlass.

After running the `generate_expected_files.sh` script in the [input](input) folder, the contents of 
the folder should be identical to the [output](output) folder. It is assumed that MartiniGlass and 
a version of Gromacs are both installed for the successful execution of the script.

Gromacs will not generate an identical starting structure for every run of `gmx insert-molecules`.
For that reason, the file `vis.gro` in the [output](output) folder may not be exactly the same as 
the one generated by the tutorial script.
