## Examples

This folder contains a number of different examples of how to use the MartiniGlass package to

Step by step methods are detailed in the tutorials page of the 
[user guide](https://martiniglass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Otherwise, each tutorial contains a README
with a brief description of its contents, and the input and output files to use and to be expected.
