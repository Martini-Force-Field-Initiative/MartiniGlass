en network bonds removed from molecule_0_en.itp
This is for noting in visualisation, not for simulation

These bonds will be missing if you load molecule_0_en.itp in vmd
having been present in your simulation. If you're inspecting your
en network because you suspect some simulation erroras a result of how it was constructed, bear this in mind.
