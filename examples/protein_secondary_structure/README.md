## Secondary structure

Input and output files for the tutorial on visualising secondary structure with MartiniGlass.

After running the `generate_expected_files.sh` script in the [input](input) folder, the contents of 
the folder should be identical to the [output](output) folder. It is assumed that MartiniGlass and 
a version of Gromacs are both installed for the successful execution of the script.

Please note this tutorial has an additional Python dependency for the assignment of secondary structure 
with `martinize2`: the [MDTraj](https://www.mdtraj.org/1.9.8.dev0/index.html) package must also be 
installed.
