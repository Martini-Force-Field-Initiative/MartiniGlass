## Secondary structure

Input and output files for the tutorial on visualising secondary structure with MartiniGlass.

Using the files in the [input](input) folder, the `generate_expected_files.sh` script should generate
the files found in the [output](output) folder. The script assumes there are installations of both
`martiniglass` and `martinize2` available. If your Python environment has the former installed, the
latter will also be.

Please note this tutorial has an additional Python dependency for the assignment of secondary structure 
with `martinize2`: the [MDTraj](https://www.mdtraj.org/1.9.8.dev0/index.html) package must also be 
installed.
