## non protein system


Input and output files for a non-protein system with MartiniGlass. This example demonstrates 
how MartiniGlass is generally applicable for any system containing coarse grained molecules
from the Martini force field.

The example here contains lipids and several molecular motors, as described by 
[Vainikka and Marrink](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00796>).

Using the files in the [input](input) folder, the `generate_expected_files.sh` script should generate
the files found in the [output](output) folder. The script assumes that an installation of
`martiniglass` is readily available.
