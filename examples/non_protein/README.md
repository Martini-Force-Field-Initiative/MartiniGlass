## non protein system


Input and output files for a non-protein system with MartiniGlass. This example demonstrates 
how MartiniGlass is generally applicable for any system containing coarse grained molecules
from the Martini force field.

The example here contains lipids and several molecular motors, as described by 
[Vainikka and Marrink](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00796>).

After running the `generate_expected_files.sh` script in the [input](input) folder, the contents of 
the folder should be identical to the [output](output) folder. It is assumed that MartiniGlass and 
a version of Gromacs are both installed for the successful execution of the script.
