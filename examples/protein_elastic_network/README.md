## Elastic networks

Input and output files for the tutorial on visualising elastic networks with MartiniGlass.

After running the `generate_expected_files.sh` script in the [input](input) folder, the contents of 
the folder should be identical to the [output](output) folder. It is assumed that MartiniGlass and 
a version of Gromacs are both installed for the successful execution of the script.
