Elastic network bonds removed from molecule_0_en.itp
This is for noting in visualisation, not for simulation

These bonds will be missing if you load molecule_0_en.itp in vmd
having been present in your simulation. If you're inspecting your
elastic network because you suspect some error because of it, bear this in mind.
