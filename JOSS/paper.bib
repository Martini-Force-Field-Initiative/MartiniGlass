	abstract = {The Martini model, a coarse-grained force field for molecular dynamics simulations, has been around for nearly two decades. Originally developed for lipid-based systems by the groups of Marrink and Tieleman, the Martini model has over the years been extended as a community effort to the current level of a general-purpose force field. Apart from the obvious benefit of a reduction in computational cost, the popularity of the model is largely due to the systematic yet intuitive building-block approach that underlies the model, as well as the open nature of the development and its continuous validation. The easy implementation in the widely used Gromacs software suite has also been instrumental. Since its conception in 2002, the Martini model underwent a gradual refinement of the bead interactions and a widening scope of applications. In this review, we look back at this development, culminating with the release of the Martini 3 version in 2021. The power of the model is illustrated with key examples of recent important findings in biological and material sciences enabled with Martini, as well as examples from areas where coarse-grained resolution is essential, namely high-throughput applications, systems with large complexity, and simulations approaching the scale of whole cells.

	abstract = {The Martini 3 force field is a full reparametrization of the Martini coarse-grained model for biomolecular simulations. Due to the improved interaction balance, it allows for a more accurate description of condensed phase systems. In the present work, we develop a consistent strategy to parametrize carbohydrate molecules accurately within the framework of Martini 3. In particular, we develop a canonical mapping scheme which decomposes arbitrarily large carbohydrates into a limited number of fragments. Bead types for these fragments have been assigned by matching physicochemical properties of mono- and disaccharides. In addition, guidelines for assigning bonds, angles, and dihedrals were developed. These guidelines enable a more accurate description of carbohydrate conformations than in the Martini 2 force field. We show that models obtained with this approach are able to accurately reproduce osmotic pressures of carbohydrate water solutions. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the model differentiates correctly the solubility of the polyglucoses dextran (water-soluble) and cellulose (water insoluble but soluble in ionic liquids). Finally, we demonstrate that the new building blocks can be applied to glycolipids. We show they are able to reproduce membrane properties and induce binding of peripheral membrane proteins. These test cases demonstrate the validity and transferability of our approach.},

Although thorough theoretical work utilizing QM and QM/MM methods have mapped out many of the critical properties of MSs and MMs, as the experimental setups become more complex and ambitious, there is an ever increasing need to study the behavior and dynamics of these molecules as they interact with their environment. To this end, we have parametrized two coarse-grained (CG) models of commonly used MMs and a model for an oxindole-based MS, which can be used to study the ground state behavior of MMs and MSs in large simulations for significantly longer periods of time. We also propose methods to perturb these systems which can allow users to approximate how such systems would respond to MMs rotating or the MSs switching.},

	abstract = {Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network, and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used to convert the entire I-TASSER protein template database as high-complexity benchmark and illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safe guard high-throughput applications.},

Consequently, computational models play an ever-increasing role in the field. However, biological processes involving large-scale protein assemblies or long time scale dynamics are still computationally expensive to study in atomistic detail. For these applications, employing coarse-grained (CG) modeling approaches has become a key strategy. In this Review, we provide an overview of what we call pragmatic CG protein models, which are strategies combining, at least in part, a physics-based implementation and a top-down experimental approach to their parametrization. In particular, we focus on CG models in which most protein residues are represented by at least two beads, allowing these models to retain some degree of chemical specificity. A description of the main modern pragmatic protein CG models is provided, including a review of the most recent applications and an outlook on future perspectives in the field.},

	abstract = {The RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is associated with mRNA processing and transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. TDP-43 localizes in the nucleus as well as accumulating in cytoplasmic condensates such as stress granules. Aggregation and formation of amyloid-like ﬁbrils of cytoplasmic TDP-43 are hallmarks of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, most strikingly present in {\textgreater}90\% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. If excessive accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 causes, or is caused by, neurodegeneration is presently not known. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations at multiple resolutions to explore TDP-43 self- and cross-interaction dynamics. A full-length molecular model of TDP-43, all 414 amino acids, was constructed from select structures of the protein functional domains (N-terminal domain, and two RNA recognition motifs, RRM1 and RRM2) and modeling of disordered connecting loops and the low complexity glycine-rich C-terminus domain. All-atom CHARMM36m simulations of single TDP-43 proteins served as guides to construct a coarse-grained Martini 3 model of TDP43. The Martini model and a coarser implicit solvent C⍺ model, optimized for disordered proteins, were subsequently used to probe TDP-43 interactions; self-interactions from single-chain full-length TDP-43 simulations, cross-interactions from simulations with two proteins and simulations with assemblies of dozens to hundreds of proteins. Our ﬁndings illustrate the utility of different modeling scales for accessing TDP-43 molecular-level interactions and suggest that TDP-43 has numerous interaction preferences or patterns, exhibiting an overall strong, but dynamic, association and driving the formation of biomolecular condensates.},

Here, we have built coarse-grained models for a few well-known and actively studied deep eutectic solvents using the recently published Martini 3 force field. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that our models predict the properties of these particular DESs with an acceptable accuracy, and they are capable of capturing known liquid–liquid extraction processes as well as morphological shape changes of surfactant aggregates.

	abstract = {Structure-based and physics-based coarse-grained molecular force fields have become attractive approaches to gain mechanistic insight into the function of large biomolecular assemblies. Here, we study how both approaches can be combined into a single representation, that we term ELNEDIN. In this representation an elastic network is used as a structural scaffold to describe and maintain the overall shape of a protein and a physics-based coarse-grained model (MARTINI-2.1) is used to describe both inter- and intramolecular interactions in the system. The results show that when used in molecular dynamics simulations ELNEDIN models can be built so that the resulting structural and dynamical properties of a protein, including its collective motions, are comparable to those obtained using atomistic protein models. We then evaluate the behavior of such models in (1) long, microsecond time-scale, simulations, (2) the modeling of very large macromolecular assemblies, a viral capsid, and (3) the study of a protein−protein association process, the reassembly of the ROP homodimer. The results for this series of tests indicate that ELNEDIN models allow microsecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations to be carried out readily, that large biological entities such as the viral capsid of the cowpea mosaic virus can be stably modeled as assemblies of independent ELNEDIN models, and that ELNEDIN models show significant promise for modeling protein−protein association processes.},

	abstract = {We systematically parameterized a coarse-grained (CG) model for DNA that is compatible with the Martini force field. The model maps each nucleotide into six to seven CG beads and is parameterized following the Martini philosophy. The CG nonbonded interactions are based on partitioning of the nucleobases between polar and nonpolar solvents as well as base–base potential of mean force calculations. The bonded interactions are fit to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) atomistic simulations and an elastic network is used to retain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other specific DNA conformations. We present the implementation of the Martini DNA model and demonstrate the properties of individual bases, ssDNA as well as dsDNA, and DNA–protein complexes. The model opens up large-scale simulations of DNA interacting with a wide range of other (bio)molecules that are available within the Martini framework.},

	abstract = {The coarse-grained Martini model is employed extensively to study membrane protein oligomerization. While this approach is exceptionally promising given its computational efficiency, it is alarming that a significant fraction of these studies demonstrate unrealistic protein clusters, whose formation is essentially an irreversible process. This suggests that the protein–protein interactions are exaggerated in the Martini model. If this held true, then it would limit the applicability of Martini to study multi-protein complexes, as the rapidly clustering proteins would not be able to properly sample the correct dimerization conformations. In this work we first demonstrate the excessive protein aggregation by comparing the dimerization free energies of helical transmembrane peptides obtained with the Martini model to those determined from FRET experiments. Second, we show that the predictions provided by the Martini model for the structures of transmembrane domain dimers are in poor agreement with the corresponding structures resolved using NMR. Next, we demonstrate that the first issue can be overcome by slightly scaling down the Martini protein–protein interactions in a manner, which does not interfere with the other Martini interaction parameters. By preventing excessive, irreversible, and non-selective aggregation of membrane proteins, this approach renders the consideration of lateral dynamics and protein–lipid interactions in crowded membranes by the Martini model more realistic. However, this adjusted model does not lead to an improvement in the predicted dimer structures. This implicates that the poor agreement between the Martini model and NMR structures cannot be cured by simply uniformly reducing the interactions between all protein beads. Instead, a careful amino-acid specific adjustment of the protein–protein interactions is likely required.},

	abstract = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations enable the modeling of increasingly complex systems at millisecond timescales. The transferable coarse-grained force field Martini 3 has shown great promise in modeling a wide range of biochemical processes, yet folded proteins in Martini 3 are not stable without the application of external bias potentials, such as elastic networks or Go̅-like models. We herein develop an algorithm, called OLIVES, which identifies native contacts with hydrogen bond capabilities in coarse-grained proteins and use it to implement a novel Go̅-like model for Martini 3. We show that the protein structure instability originates in part from the lack of hydrogen bond energy in the coarse-grained force field representation. By using realistic hydrogen bond energies obtained from literature ab initio calculations, it is demonstrated that protein stability can be recovered by the reintroduction of a coarse-grained hydrogen bond network and that OLIVES removes the need for secondary structure restraints. OLIVES is validated against known protein complexes and at the same time addresses the open question of whether there is a need for protein quaternary structure bias in Martini 3 simulations. It is shown that OLIVES can reduce the number of bias terms, hereby speeding up Martini 3 simulations of proteins by up to ≈30\% on a GPU architecture compared to the established Go̅MARTINI Go̅-like model.},
